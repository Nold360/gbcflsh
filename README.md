# GameBoy Cart Flasher v1.1

**This version has been hacked by nold to compile & work with a modern Linux distribution.**

## Known Issues

 - Translations seems broken
 - Windows support ... but who cares...

## From Original Readme

This program is distributed under GNU General Public Licence, see the "COPYING" 
file for details.

Build and install procedure is described in "INSTALL" file.

Under Windows we recommend to use binary install package, unless you want to
improve this software. There is possibility of adding new translations for
not yet supported languages. Process of making translation files is described
in "INSTALL" file.

Linux USB version is not as good as Windows, because of the way Linux is 
realizing direct access to USB hardware.

**It's important to USE USB VERSION WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES!**
